# groq-frontend
Super lightweight frontend for groq API. Has a rudimentary memory for follow-up questions. That's about it.

_Speeds above are in realtime_

You may need these requirements:

```
pip install flask groq markdown
```

Start it up:

```
python app.py
```

This assumes you have your `GROQ_API_KEY` env var set. You can get one [here](https://console.groq.com/keys)

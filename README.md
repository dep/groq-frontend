# groq-frontend
Super lightweight frontend for groq API. Has a rudimentary memory for follow-up questions. That's about it.

You may need these requirements:

```
pip install flask
pip install groq
pip install markdown
```

Start it up:

```
python app.py
```

This assumes you have your GROQ_API_KEY env var set
